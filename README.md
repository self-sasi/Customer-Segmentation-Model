# Customer Segmentation README

### About Model
This Jupyter notebook is designed to perform customer data segmentation, likely focusing on understanding different customer behaviors or profiles based on shopping data.

### Dependencies
- **numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **sklearn**: Machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
- **mpl_toolkits.mplot3d**: 3D plotting tools.

### Steps in the Notebook

1. **Importing Libraries**: The notebook imports numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and mpl_toolkits for various data analysis tasks.
2. **Data Loading and Preparation**: Customer data is loaded, possibly from 'Mall_Customers.csv', and prepared for analysis.
3. **Data Exploration (Optional)**: The notebook might include steps to explore the data to understand distributions, relationships, or anomalies.
4. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and preprocessed, including scaling and other necessary transformations.
5. **Applying KMeans Clustering**: The KMeans algorithm from sklearn is used to segment customers into groups.
6. **Determining the Number of Clusters**: An elbow plot is likely created to determine the optimal number of clusters.
7. **Cluster Visualization**: Clusters are visualized in a 3D scatter plot using matplotlib's 3D toolkit.
8. **Analysis of Clusters**: Clusters are examined, with potential customizations and interpretations of each cluster.
